This project is created using Arduino Uno and Visual Micro Plugin(Version 12.0.21005.1 REL) for Visual Studio 2013.
You can either import this project if you have plugin in Visual Studio and drop libraries to your Arduino IDE directory i.e.
C:\Program Files (x86)\arduino-1.0.5-r2 or you can work directly with Arduino IDE itself.

I used libraries and code found in BlackX LED Cube 0.1, which is at the moment available online. Also I created CubeAnimation library.
